This version implements the basic first set of functionality.
There is no centralized JSON interface yet.

START-UP:
	- Administration:
		Run the controller.Administration class
	- ATM 
		Run the controller.ATM class

DATABASES:
	- original.db is the empty version of the database
	- userdata.db is the filled version which is accessed by the implementation.
	
	Integrity of the database is checked with startup, and eventually created if missing.
